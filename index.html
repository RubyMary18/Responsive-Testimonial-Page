                        incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
                        12 weeks was the best - and most gruelling - time of my

                    "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of
                    code. I needed some structure from professionals who can
                    help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to
                    enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say
                    wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculam
                    and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I
                    never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
                    project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning
                    to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
                    In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an
                    example of my development experience. It certaintly helped
                    me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                    multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
